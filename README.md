# tamagotchi
PROJECT-ZERO - GENERAL ASSEMBLY - BY DEREK OSHITA 6/22


// --- Scope --- // 

The final objective is to build a tamagotchi game where a user will interact with the tamagotchi in order to prevent it from dying...

Technologies in play: 
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Vanilla JavaScript 
4. jQuery
5. Google Fonts
6. Animate.css
7. Eggradients.com 


// --- User Story / Gameplay Logic --- // 

A user is defined as any individual who opens the tamagotchi page and interacts with it. 

1. The user will start by entering a name into the text field then clicking the "create" button. The button will store that name in an object and then create the object with all of its values. It will also initiate the timer, represented by age. 

2. Three metrics will also be shown: hunger, sleepiness, and boredom. Each metric will initiate at 0. The metrics will increment every 5 minutes. If any of the metrics reaches 10, the tamagotchi WILL PERISH. 

3. The user can decrement the value of each metric- hunger, boredom, and sleepiness will be decremented by feed, play, and turn off the lights respectively. Each click will represent 1 decrement in order to prevent any metric from reaching 10. 

4. Every 10 seconds, the the pet wil morph/evolve and the round will be updated. There will be three rounds. 

5. The player wins if they can keep the tamagotchi alive for 30 seconds and all of the metrics under 10 during that time.
