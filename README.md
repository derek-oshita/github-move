# tamagotchi
PROJECT-ZERO - GENERAL ASSEMBLY - BY DEREK OSHITA 6/22


// --- Scope --- // 

The final objective is to build a tamagotchi game, where a user will interact with the tamagotchi in order to prevent it from dying.

Technologies in play: 
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Vanilla JavaScript 
4. jQuery 


// --- User Story / Gameplay Logic --- // 

A user is defined as any individual who opens the tamagotchi page and interacts with it. 

1. The user will start by entering a name into the text field then clicking the "create" button. The button will store that name in an object and then create the object with all of it's values. 

2. Once the user clicks the button, an image will appear and the user will be prompted to name their tamagotchi. Once named, it will initiate a timer representing the tamagotchi's age. 

3. Three metrics will also be displayed: hunger, sleepiness, and boredom. Each metric will initiate at 0. The metrics will increment every two hours. If any of the metrics reach 10, the tamagotchi WILL PERISH. 

4. The user can decrement the value of each metric- hunger, boredom, and sleepiness will be decremented by feed, play, and turn off the lights respectively. Each click will represent 1 decrement in order to prevent any metric from reaching 10. 

5. Every 24 hours, the the pet wil morph/evolve, creating another stage. There will be three stages. 

6. The player wins if they can keep the tamagotchi alive through the third stage.
